# Spuren im Netz

"Spuren im Netz" is an educational application aimed specifically at children of primary school age to teach them the basics of using social media in a fun way. The children become part of a fascinating adventure in which they work together with Pixel, a clever fox, to answer important questions on topics such as data protection and security. Through interactive and engaging content, children learn how to act responsibly and respectfully on social media in a safe way. "Traces on the Web" not only promotes digital literacy, but also raises awareness of how to use online content safely - an essential skill for the younger generation.
